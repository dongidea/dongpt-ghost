# Ghost Stories

## Installation

1. Download ghoststories.zip from your ThemeSpectre.com order page or confirmation email.
2. Create a folder/subdirectory called 'ghoststories' in `/content/themes/`.
3. Unzip ghoststories.zip into `/content/themes/ghoststories/`.
4. Restart Ghost.
5. Log into the Ghost admin panel.
6. Go to *Settings > General* and select **ghoststories** as your Theme.
7. Save the settings.

## Customization

In *Settings > General* several options will alter the content in *Ghost Stories*:

* **Blog Title** - Appears on the first page in the title section.
* **Blog Description** - Appears underneath the title on the first page. Also inserted as the meta description in the blog header.
* **Blog Cover** - This will appear as a full background image of the first page.
* **Posts per page** - Determines how many stories are presented in total. **Please set this as high as possible to ensure all of your stories are viewable!**

Further customizations will be implemented in the near future.

### Featured Images / Post Thumbnails

In the Ghost Stories theme, every post has a cover image displayed on the left half of the browser window.
This image is the *first image inserted into your post*.  Ghost Stories takes the first image inserted into the post and moves it into the cover.

For example, create a new post in Ghost.
In the content window, hit Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I to insert a new image snippet.
Upload a new image, or enter the URL for an online image.
This image will be featured as the thumbnail on the homepage. Any other images within your post will be displayed normally.

Additional options for images and media will become available in future releases of Ghost Stories.
